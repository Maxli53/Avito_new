# New Developer Competency Checklist
**Snowmobile Product Data Reconciliation System**

## üéØ Immediate Expectations

The previous developer was terminated for failing to meet professional standards. This checklist ensures the new developer understands and can demonstrate competency in our established requirements.

## üìã Day 1: Setup Validation

### Environment Setup (Must Complete 100%)
- [ ] **Poetry Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` configured correctly (NO requirements.txt)
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks**: Installed and passing all checks
- [ ] **Type Checking**: `mypy --strict` passes with zero errors
- [ ] **Code Quality**: `black`, `ruff`, `safety` all configured and passing
- [ ] **Testing Framework**: pytest with coverage ‚â•80% setup
- [ ] **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ running with proper schema
- [ ] **Claude API**: Valid API key configured and tested
- [ ] **Git Workflow**: Proper branch naming and commit message format

### Competency Demonstration
```bash
# Must execute successfully:
make check-all          # All quality checks pass
make test-coverage      # 80%+ coverage achieved
make type-check         # Zero mypy errors
make security-scan      # No vulnerabilities
make db-migrate        # Database operations work
```

**Automatic Disqualification**: Any failure in setup validation indicates inability to follow basic professional standards.

## üß™ Day 2-3: Technical Understanding

### Code Review Assessment
- [ ] **Pydantic Models**: Understands why we use Pydantic vs. dataclasses
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Can explain typing system and add hints correctly
- [ ] **Repository Pattern**: Understands separation of data access and business logic
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Can implement proper exception handling
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Writes meaningful tests, not just coverage fillers

### Practical Test: MVTL Case Study
Implement a test function that demonstrates understanding:

```python
def test_mvtl_complete_processing(self):
    """
    Process MVTL variant through complete pipeline
    Must demonstrate understanding of:
    - Data parsing and validation
    - Product matching logic
    - Claude API integration
    - Database operations
    - Error handling
    """
    
    # Input: Raw Finnish price list entry
    raw_entry = "MVTL|Backcountry|X-RS|850 E-TEC|137in/3500mm|Electric|10.25 in. Color Touchscreen|Scandi Blue|21 950,00 ‚Ç¨"
    
    # Expected output: Complete product with specifications
    expected_output = {
        "sku": "MVTL",
        "confidence_score": 0.98,  # Must be ‚â•0.95
        "specifications": {
            "engine": {"model": "850 E-TEC", "displacement_cc": 849, "hp": 165},
            "track": {"length_mm": 3500, "width_mm": 381},
            "weight": {"dry_weight_kg": 203}
        }
    }
    
    # Implementation must follow all established patterns
```

### Technical Interview Questions
1. **Why PostgreSQL JSONB?** (Must understand flexible schema benefits)
2. **Confidence Scoring**: How do you determine 0.95 threshold?
3. **Claude API Optimization**: How do you minimize API costs?
4. **Error Recovery**: What happens when parsing fails?
5. **Performance**: How do you handle 1000+ product catalogs?

## üéØ Week 1: Production Readiness

### Feature Implementation Test
**Assignment**: Implement a complete feature following all standards

#### Requirements
- [ ] **Feature**: Add support for new market (Denmark - DK)
- [ ] **Database**: Create migration for new market support
- [ ] **Parsing**: Handle Danish currency and language
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation
- [ ] **Performance**: No degradation in processing speed

#### Validation Criteria
```python
# All of these must pass:
assert migration_is_reversible()
assert all_tests_pass_with_coverage_80_plus()
assert mypy_strict_zero_errors()
assert no_hardcoded_values()
assert proper_error_handling()
assert performance_benchmarks_met()
assert documentation_updated()
```

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Required Patterns (Must Demonstrate)
```python
# 1. Proper Pydantic model usage
class DanishPriceEntry(BaseModel):
    raw_sku: str = Field(regex=r'^[A-Z0-9]{3,6}$')
    price_dkk: Decimal = Field(gt=0)
    market: Literal["DK"] = "DK"

# 2. Repository pattern implementation
class DanishPriceRepository:
    async def save_price_entry(self, entry: DanishPriceEntry) -> None:
        # Database operations with proper error handling

# 3. Service layer with dependency injection
class DanishMarketService:
    def __init__(self, repository: DanishPriceRepository):
        self.repository = repository
    
    async def process_danish_prices(self, pdf_path: str) -> ProcessingResult:
        # Business logic with comprehensive error handling
```

#### Anti-Patterns (Immediate Rejection)
```python
# ‚ùå NEVER do this:
class Product:  # Using regular class instead of Pydantic
    def __init__(self, sku, price):
        self.sku = sku  # No type hints
        self.price = price

# ‚ùå Hardcoded values
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.95  # Should be configurable

# ‚ùå Poor error handling
try:
    result = api_call()
except:  # Generic exception handling
    pass

# ‚ùå Direct database access in business logic
def process_product(sku):
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM products WHERE sku = %s", (sku,))
```
