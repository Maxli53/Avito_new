Domain Model Architecture Explanation
=====================================

The Domain Model defines the DATA STRUCTURE BLUEPRINT for the entire snowmobile system.
It's like the "contract" that ensures all data follows the same rules and format.

    The Domain Model is the CORE DATA BLUEPRINT that defines:
    • How data is structured (what fields exist)
    • Data validation rules (types, constraints)
    • Business logic and relationships
    • Data transformation rules
    
    Think of it as the "schema" or "contract" for ALL system data.
