agree. Answers: 1. yes. 2.  yes 3. I think yes. sounds logical. for me the starting point as a human is that i always look at the price list first and then analyze for more details for the model family. the nuance is, as you probably see, that LTTA might be a spring specific model and i need to know what is it exactly that is spring specific. Usually, such spring specific models have spring options such as, special suspension, track dimensions, colour, gauge type etc. I can spot the spring specific model in couple of ways: first, the model code (the four letters) is highlighet (its not the case for LTTA, but, for example, the LTTE is highlighted). Second, I can spot the spring specific model by looking at the Kevätoption - field in the price list - if there is text, then it means that the model has spring options. Then i read what is written in the field Kevätoptiot - the exact option is stated direclty. 

Questions for you: 1. Is the Tier 1 methodology the same as you used here for matching? Because it seems you have no issues. 2. what for Tier 2: Fuzzy match model descriptions if exact fails?
